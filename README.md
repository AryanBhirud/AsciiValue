# AsciiValue
Learning programming as a student requires the use of ascii values in the programs i write for my university assignments. However i never remember the ascii values and allways have to look them up on the internet and the process of doing that was very irritating to me. To solve this i made a simple website using a few simple lines of code. This website shows you the ascii value of whichever key you press. It is a much faster and efficient solution which doesnt require a lot of code.
